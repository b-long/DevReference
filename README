The Command-line (Shell) and Terminal Reference

This repository started as a place to store my own POSIX (Unix/Linux) & Windows command cheat sheet.  It's now grown a bit larger and so it was renamed from "MyLinuxAndUnixStuff" (appropriately, since it contains Windows command-line material as well).

The naming scheme is somewhat based on a useful question from StackExcahnge, namely "<a href=\"http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/4126/11917\">What is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'?</a>.  The repository contains handy POSIX (Linux & Unix) & Windows (Command Prompt/`cmd.exe`) snippets as well as some useful configuration files.
